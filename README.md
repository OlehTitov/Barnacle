*A barnacle — the crustacean that's always attached, always listening.*

**Open source** under the **GPL-3.0 License**. Inspect it, modify it, build it yourself — no App Store required. Any derivative must stay open source.

## Why

Your gateway token and microphone are sensitive. Barnacle is fully transparent — you can read every line of code, build it yourself in Xcode, and know exactly what's running on your device. No App Store download required.

## License

GPL-3.0 — use it, modify it, distribute it, but any derivative work must also be open source under GPL-3.0.
